What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository creates a hidden .git folder to store metadata that tracks history of files in the 
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediary acting between a working directory and a commit. The files to be included in the 
commit are first added to a staging area which are then added to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging are ensures that a final check can be made before commiting a change. This way the changes made
can be checked to ensure that the commit contains a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Creating an experimental feature or testing some features which might not be usable right now can be a good case
for creating branches to keep history organised.
