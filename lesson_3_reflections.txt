When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working on a project with a team can be greatly simplified by keeping a remote repository as it is easily accesible 
by all the team members

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?

As the repository on GitHub is not the exact same as the one saved offline, the files are manually added or removed 
from either offline or GitHub. It thus makes sense to keep track of files manual rather than automating it
